## 🔗**Component Interactions**

- **Cloud Access Limitations**: Unfortunately, due to the requirement for credit card verification to access cloud platforms, I was unable to leverage free tiers or trial accounts. This constraint limited my ability to test and build infrastructure directly in cloud environments.

- **Local Environment Challenges**: Initially, I attempted to use to build and manage infrastructure on Windows.

  - However, I encountered persistent compatibility issues between **Terraform** and **Docker Desktop**, which hindered the effective setup and management of the infrastructure.

![Scout](./assets/images/infrastructure/scout.png)

- **Workaround with Vagrant**: To address these issues, I transitioned to using a based setup on a **Ubuntu** environment.

  - This local setup offered several advantages:

    - **Better Compatibility**: Allowed me to create a more controlled and compatible environment for running, addressing the compatibility problems faced with **Docker**.

    - **Local Testing and Development**: The environment provided a local solution for testing and development, enabling me to proceed with Terraform configurations and infrastructure management without relying on cloud resources.

    - **CI/CD Pipeline Preparation**: By using, I could still develop and test my infrastructure as code locally.

      - This setup ensured that once cloud access is available or feasible, the transition from local development to a cloud environment via pipelines with **GitHub Actions** would be smoother.

    - **Future Integration**: The based local setup serves as a temporary measure, allowing me to refine and validate the infrastructure code. Once cloud access is possible, I plan to migrate the tested configurations to a cloud environment for final deployment and scaling.

- **Design Choices**:

  1. **Scalability**:

      - The choice of **RabbitMQ** as the message broker, and a columnar database like **Postgres** supports high-throughput data streams and complex analytical queries, making it suitable for data-intensive applications.

  2. **Flexibility**:

      - The use of **Flask** for API development provides flexibility and ease of integration with various third-party applications and tools, enabling customized and scalable solutions.

      - This API provides standard HTTP methods for interacting with the data, making it easy for third-party applications and users to access and visualize the data using tools like **ELK**, **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, and **Loki**.

  3. **Infrastructure Management with Terraform**:

      - The entire infrastructure, including the Pub/Sub, database, and API, is provisioned and managed.

      - Ensures that the environment is consistently configured and easily replicable across different stages of the development lifecycle.

  4. **Containerization and Deployment with Docker**:

      - **Image Build**: The application is containerized, with a Dockerfile that defines the environment and dependencies.

    1. **Latency**

         - **Description**: Measures the time taken for a data packet to travel from its source to its destination. In distributed systems, latency indicates communication efficiency between services.

          - **Importance**: High latency can signal network issues, bottlenecks in the architecture, or overload in system components.

          - **Monitoring**: Measure latency across different system layers (e.g., frontend, backend, and between microservices) to identify and address issues.

    2. **Error Rate**

       - **Description**: Represents the percentage of requests resulting in errors (e.g., HTTP 4xx and 5xx codes) out of the total requests processed.
       - **Importance**: A rise in error rate may indicate problems such as configuration errors, failures in external dependencies, or network issues.
       - **Monitoring**: Track error rates at both individual service levels and across the system to detect localized and global failures.

    3. **Throughput**

         - **Description**: Measures the amount of data the system can process within a given time period, typically in terms of transactions per second or requests per minute.
         - **Importance**: Low throughput can indicate performance issues like resource saturation and affects the system's ability to handle high traffic volumes.
         - **Monitoring**: Monitor throughput at various points in the system to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle expected traffic loads.
